# Collection of Usefull Functions and Classes

## WORK IN PROGRESS

This collection is supposed to serve as submodule during developments. After adding the submodule to a project, make a .gitignore file that includes all the files that you don't care about and the `.gitignore` itself. Then you can easily  delete/modify the ones that you don't care to track.
